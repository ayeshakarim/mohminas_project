					<h1>How it all started... <img src="images/july 2019 before image.jpg" alt=""> </h1>
					
				
					<p>I started my journey when my appearance hit me so hard that I chose to avoid looking in a mirror wherever I could. I stopped caring about my clothing because I felt like I couldn’t pull anything off no matter how nice it was.</p>

				<div class="article">
					<h1>Time for a change</h1>
					<p>It was my decisions that put me in that position, into that body. With poor eating habits and lack of portion control and zero exercise I had only myself to blame. I decided that it was time for change, time to bring back that lost confidence.</p>
					<h1>Training your appetite</h1>
					<p>My body was so used to such large portion sizes. My first objective was to make myself feel content with the food on my plate. </p> 
				

        
                    <p>I created a healthy meal plan and I cut the meal size in half and yes what you’re thinking is correct. I was still hungry! I continued with this for the first month and by the end of it my body was happy with the amount it was receiving. </p>
                    <p>When I started eating the regular sized portions again according to the plan, I was so full I had food leftover! I wasn’t hungry for seconds, I wasn’t picking at food throughout the day.

					<h1>Taste is important too</h1>
					<p>What is the point if you don’t enjoy it? This is your new lifestyle and you need to own it. I tried to “diet” on many occasions in the past. I always wondered why it failed every time.</p>
                    <p>I would eat boiled eggs, plain chicken with side salads and lots of vegetables. The mistake I made was that it was NOT sustainable. I was not happy meaning it was only going to end in failure right?</p>
                    <p>I made a list of food that I enjoy eating, I cut out food that could not be compromised with. I still had two pages of ingredients that could be used as part of a fat loss weight plan. I felt satisfied after every meal, I felt happy knowing that I consumed a delicious meal with no regrets.</p>
